                        <p class="paragraph">
                            The International Union for Conservation of Nature
                            Red List classifies many species of whales and
                            dolphins as threatened in the Mediterranean.
                            Research into cetaceans focuses on their strandings
                            and sightings, there is little knowledge about their
                            movements, whale pod composition and their
                            behaviour. This lack of information makes it
                            difficult to understand the threats to cetaceans and
                            to develop effective conservation strategies.
                            <br /><br />
                            This objective of the project is to create machine
                            learning models to predict the behaviour of sperm
                            whales in the Mediterranean Sea. Using data from
                            Oceanomare Delphis we aim to learn more about the
                            behaviour of cetaceans, and to use this information
                            to help guide legislation to protect them.

                            Oceanomare Delphis is a non-profit organisation that
                            gathers data on behavioural ecology and acoustics of
                            cetaceans. Currently their databases hold
                            information on distribution, movements, group sizes
                            and compositions, behaviours and acoustic data.
                            Oceanomare Delphis combines scientific research in
                            the field with priority objectives such as education
                            and conservation and aggregates organizations,
                            groups and individuals linked by a common interest
                            in cetaceans and the marine environment, to
                            influence institutions to take concrete action
                            against the extinction and destruction of natural
                            ecosystems caused by man.
